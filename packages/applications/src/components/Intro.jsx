      <Paragraph>This application is the start of your Kernel Unprofile. Rather than project what you think others want to hear, we ask that you speak the truth with love. This is what serves our core goal, which is to <strong>learn together</strong>.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>What you write here will be visible to a group of current fellows who review applications. We value honesty, sincerity, simplicity and a diversity of skills and interests. <a className='text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600' href='https://www.kernel.community/en/start/principled-people/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Our principles</a> are <strong>do no harm</strong> and <strong>play, infinitely</strong>. The purpose of this form is to start getting to know each other. Don't worry about proving anything, we really just want to understand what you care about.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>If you are accepted, youâ€™ll be able to update it continuously. It is your data and you are in control. This also means you are responsible for how it appears. The interplay of control and responsibility is one of the <a className='text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600' href='https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/play-of-pattern/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>complementary opposites</a> on which Kernel is based.</Paragraph>
